# ASCII Thunder Ball: Learning How To Create A Game Engine

The Thunder Ball is a command prompt game that puts you in control of a bouncing ball, letting you playfully make it zip around your terminal at high speeds. How delightful! :D

I crafted this game in 2022, inspired by the exhaustion of a day spent skiing. While basking in the warmth of a chimney, sipping hot chocolate, and sharing the moment with my aging father as we tuned into the news, I dedicated 2 to 4 hours to create this little gem. Later, I invested additional time refining the code. Developing a game engine might not be rocket science, but caution is advised before diving in headfirst!

The Thunder Ball emerged as an unintended outcome of my game engine, built entirely from scratch. I adhered to a self-imposed restriction of avoiding the internet and confined my coding activities to Microsoft's Code Block. Module downloads were the only exceptions granted. This coding venture had dual objectives:

1. To test the challenges of constructing a 2D game engine with collision and physics2.
2. To improve my coding skills and code without bugs â€“ developing those Pythonman fingers! >:D

This engine seamlessly handles high-speed objects, ensuring they never mysteriously phase through the game world. The only limitations on speed arise from friction variables. You can push the limits by removing all friction and witnessing how your computer copes with the unstoppable force that is the THUNDER BALL!

Admittedly, it's a modest project, not one to boast about extensively. But darn it, I like it!

Now, here's where I must confess a deviation from my original rules: I peeked at Stack Overflow to acquaint myself with the pynput module. This module proved invaluable for controlling and monitoring the keyboard, and I did delve into its source code to grasp its intricacies. Exceptions, after all, can be enlightening!
