# ASCII-Thunder-Ball
The thunder ball is a command prompt game in which you control a bouncing ball. You can toy around and make it bounce around your prompt at high speeds... that's that! :D

I created this game in 2022 after a long skiing day. By the warmth of a chimney while drinking hot chocolate, sitting next to my old father, watching the news. It took about 2 to 4 hours to create it and I took some time later to clean it up. Creating a game engine ain't that hard, but you better think before you act!

The Thunder Ball was created as a byproduct of my game engine, created from scratch. I followed the strict rule of not using the internet and limited myself to coding with Microsoft's Code Block. Downloading modules was allowed. This code was made with two purposes: 

1. To see how hard it is to create a 2D game engine with collisions and physics
2. To learn to code without bugs, to get the PEP8-Python fingers! >:D

This engine can work with high-speed objects without any risk of them phasing through the world. Your CPU would die before you ever succeed at making that ball fall off the screen! Any speed limitations are purely due to the friction variables. You can remove all friction to see how well your computer handles the unlimited power of the THUNDER BALL!

Yes, that's a small project, nothing to brag about. But I like it!

The exception to my rules: I did look at StackOverflow to learn about the existence of the **pynput** module, which works wonders when it comes to controlling and monitoring the keyboard. I went into the source code to learn how to use it.
